Peru is a country in western South America. <br>
it's a distillation of the oldest traditions and the finest building, <br>
weaving and art made by the most sophisticated cultures on the continent.<br>
 In Peru the wildest landscapes – from frozen Andean peaks to the deep Amazon – <br>
 help us re-forge our connection to the natural world.

 My first encounter with comida Peruana was over 20 years ago,<br>
  thanks to my wife's Peruvian family. Their cooking was a study <br>
  in juxtaposition: hot and cold, acidic and starchy, robust and delicate

  Peru's national dish, and an immediate obsession for nearly all who<br>
  try it. Though other countries may claim their own variations with shrimp,<br>
   octopus, scallops, tomatoes, and even tostada chips

  Almost as popular as ceviche, this chifa dish represents a fusion of Chinese<br>
   stir frying and classic Peruvian ingredients. The crowd-pleasing dish is found <br>
   nearly everywhere across Peru, and is equally popular in Peruvian restaurants abroad.

   Puno is a port city on the shores of Lake Titicaca on the Altiplano of Peru.<br>
    Despite its picturesque hillside setting, the city itself is a ramshackle collection<br>
    of mostly unfinished modern buildings.

    Once just an attractive roadside fishing port, Mancora is now the most<br>
     trendy beach in Peru, attracting a surf crowd from around the globe. <br>
     It’s a highly welcome and very enjoyable stopover when traveling along the north coast.
